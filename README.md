# WindowsMultiFormsApp
Malin Space Science Systems requires a Windows Application which loads data from a .csv file into a read only list box display. The user can then filter the data into a second listbox for further examination. When a record is selected from the second listbox the details are displayed in several related text boxes. The filter must be able to find and display partial results for both the ID number and the staff name. The Create, Update and Delete features must be performed in a second form which has a secure gateway. The Create option must prevent duplicate ID numbers, while the Update and Delete option must have a confirmation message (Status Strip) and roll back. If a record is selected in the first general form and requires amendment the authorised user can open the second admin form which will receive the data from the first general form. Refer to the following basic flowchart for UI actions and information flow. The full programming criteria are listed in Question 4 and 5.

This assessment is a demonstration of a keyboard driven application; therefore all actions must utilise the Alt, Ctrl and CharKey combinations.
